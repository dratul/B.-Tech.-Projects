The main objective of this project is to predict the  weather(various parameters depending upon the needs) and display it to the user. The main contributions of the work are:

\begin{tabular}{p{0.06\linewidth}p{0.94\linewidth}}
\textbf{1} &Machine Learning  has been used for weather prediction.
\\
\textbf{2} &The Prediction is done using various model training and testing in machine   learning. 
 \\
\textbf{3} & Prediction is being done here for the betterment of the experience of the person. ex.Farmer.\\

% \textbf{4} & Also, the relationship equations to represent antennas have been carried out by curve fitting.\\
% \textbf{5} & A final optimized inverted "T" shaped slotted rectangular Microstrip patch antenna with increased fragmentary bandwidth and good return loss have been proposed and experimentally verified by fabricating also, the PSO optimized antenna is obtained, designed, simulated and compared with the initial antenna.\\
