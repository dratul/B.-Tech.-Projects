\noindent Weather forecasting is the use of science and technology to predict the condition of the weather for a given area. It is one of the most difficult issues the world over. This project aims to estimate the weather by utilizing predictive analysis. For his reason, analysis of various data mining procedures is needed before applying. This introduces a classifier approach for prediction of weather conditions and shows how Regression and Neural Network algorithms can be utilized for classification purposes.

\noindent Users will enter some information such as current temperature,humidity and other parameters according to their need .This system will take this parameter and predict weather after analyzing the input information with the information in the database. Consequently two basic functions to be specific classification (training) and prediction (testing) will be performed. The outcomes demonstrated that these data mining procedures can be sufficient for weather forecasting
